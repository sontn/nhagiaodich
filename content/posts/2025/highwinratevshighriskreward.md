Many traders (even experienced ones) **fall into the trap of prioritizing a high win rate while ignoring the risk-reward ratio (RRR)**. This can be a **dangerous mistake** because a high win rate **does not guarantee profitability** if your **average losses are larger than your average wins.**

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Understanding the Difference Between Win Rate and Risk-Reward Ratio

- Win Rate (%)
  - The percentage of trades that are profitable.
  - Example: A 70% win rate means 7 out of 10 trades are winners.
- Risk-Reward Ratio (RRR)
  - Measures how much you stand to gain relative to what you risk per trade.
  - Example: An RRR of 1:2 means that for every $1 risked, you aim to make $2.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ The Hidden Danger of High-Win-Rate Strategies

Many traders prefer strategies with **a high win rate (e.g., 80-90%)**, but if the **RRR is too low (e.g., 1:0.5 or worse)**, they are exposed to huge risks.

## üí• Example of a High-Win-Rate But Low-RRR Strategy

- Win rate = 80%
- Risk-reward ratio = 1:0.5 (risking $100 to make $50)
- Over 10 trades:
  - 8 wins ‚Üí +$50 x 8 = +$400
  - 2 losses ‚Üí -$100 x 2 = -$200
  - Total profit = +$200 ‚úÖ

üëâ This seems fine, **but one bad trade or a losing streak can wipe out multiple wins.**

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ The Power of Risk-Reward Ratios in Long-Term Profitability

A **low win rate can still be highly profitable** if the risk-reward ratio is favorable.

### üí° Example of a Low-Win-Rate But High-RRR Strategy

- Win rate = 40%
- Risk-reward ratio = 1:3 (risking $100 to make $300)
- Over 10 trades:
  - 4 wins ‚Üí +$300 x 4 = +$1,200
  - 6 losses ‚Üí -$100 x 6 = -$600
  - Total profit = +$600 ‚úÖ

üëâ Even with a 40% win rate, the strategy is still profitable because the winners outweigh the losses.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Why Do Some Traders Fall into This Trap?

- ‚ùå Psychological Comfort ‚Äì High-win-rate strategies feel "safer," but they are often an illusion of security.
- ‚ùå Fear of Losing Streaks ‚Äì Traders avoid low-win-rate strategies because they feel emotionally draining.
- ‚ùå Short-Term Focus ‚Äì They don‚Äôt consider the long-term impact of poor risk-reward ratios.
- ‚ùå Ego & Overconfidence ‚Äì Some traders think winning often = being a great trader, but that‚Äôs not true.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ The Correct Approach: Balance Win Rate & RRR

### ‚úÖ Ideal Trading Mindset:

- Focus on positive expectancy (not just win rate).
- Aim for a RRR of at least 1:2 or higher whenever possible.
- Accept that losing trades are normal, but profits should always be larger than losses.
- Find a balance: Not too low a win rate, not too low an RRR.

**üöÄ The best traders are NOT the ones who win the most trades, but the ones who make the most money overall.**

# I have experience with a high win rate. It's desirable. It's easy to win even a lot of trades, but so small profits. But when a failed trade with big loss it will throw away previous profits before.

Exactly! High-win-rate strategies feel comfortable because you win often, but they can be deceptive. If the reward per trade is too small compared to the risk, one bad trade can erase multiple wins.

This is why **risk management and proper RRR** are so important. Many traders eventually shift toward strategies that **balance win rate and RRR rather than just maximizing win rate alone**. Have you considered adjusting your approach to include slightly larger RRR while maintaining a reasonable win rate?

# I want to have a high RR, a low win rate is ok. I accept win rate of about 30-40% but I see I have not caught the RR more than 3 or 4 often.

That makes sense! Shifting to a high RR strategy requires a different mindset and execution style. If you're aiming for RR >3 or 4 consistently, some key things to focus on:

- 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Patience & Entry Selection** ‚Äì Only take trades from really strong key levels or high-probability setups.
- 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Letting Trades Run** ‚Äì Avoid closing early; trust the plan even if price pulls back.
- 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Tighter Stop Losses** ‚Äì Refining stop placements (e.g., using structure, volatility) can help increase RR without needing huge moves.
- 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Higher Timeframes** ‚Äì Sometimes, bigger RR trades are easier to catch on H4/Daily because of larger swings.

Are you finding it difficult to hold trades long enough for big RR, or is the challenge more about finding the right setups?

# There are two problems for me now, one is about the entry, and one is about the keep profit running. My entry is not good enough so that the SL is not too long. That cause the profit reward not good.

Got it! Your SL being too long makes it harder to achieve a high RR, and even when you do get a good entry, it's tough to hold for full profit.

For **better entries** (shorter SL, higher RR):

- **Refine key levels:** Only enter at strong levels with clear rejection.
- **Wait for confirmation:** Instead of entering too early, let the market show its hand (e.g., strong wick rejection, engulfing candles).
- **Use tighter SL logic:** Place SL based on structure, volatility zones, or ATR rather than a fixed distance.

For **keeping profits running**:

- **Partial TP method:** If possible, secure some profit at RR = 2, then let the rest run.
- **Trailing SL smartly:** Move SL based on structure shifts, not just randomly.
- **Focus on execution, not outcome:** Trust your plan, detach from individual trade results.

Which of these do you think would help you most right now? Or do you want to fine-tune something specific?

# I have not been good enough for finding key levels and observer the candlestick pattern at the key levels.

That makes sense! Key levels and candlestick confirmation are crucial for strong entries. Since you're already using pivot points and swing points on H1/M15 for gold, refining that further could help.

Here‚Äôs a simple approach to improve:

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Key Levels:

- Focus on **strong reaction zones** (previous highs/lows, pivot points, supply/demand zones).
- The more times price reacts at a level, the stronger it is.
- Use H1 for main levels, M15 for fine-tuning entries.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Candlestick Patterns for Entry:

- **Strong rejection wicks (pin bars, engulfing patterns)** confirm a level is holding.
- **Wait for confirmation**, don‚Äôt rush in too early.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Backtest & Observe:

- Mark key levels first, then check how price reacts there historically.
- Does price break through or reject? What pattern shows up before a strong move?
