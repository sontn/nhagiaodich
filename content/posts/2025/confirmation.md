🚫 NO – Trading without confirmations is like guessing. You might win sometimes, but long-term success requires a structured approach.

✅ YES, If You Learn to Wait for High-Quality Setups – A good trader only takes high-probability trades by waiting for clear confirmations.

## Why Confirmations Matter in Trading

Without confirmations, you’re trading based on hope, not logic. Here’s what happens:

🚫 Without Confirmation:

You enter too early → Price moves against you → Hit SL.

You enter randomly → Win/loss ratio is bad → Lose money over time.

You don’t have confidence → Keep second-guessing trades → Emotional stress.

✅ With Confirmations:

Higher win rate → You only enter strong setups.

Fewer losses → You avoid bad trades.

More confidence → You trust your process instead of gambling.

📌 Example:
If price touches SMA 50, you don’t buy immediately. Instead, you:

1️⃣ Wait for a bullish rejection wick or engulfing candle.

2️⃣ Check RSI → Is it above 50?

3️⃣ Confirm trend → Is SMA 10 above SMA 50?

4️⃣ Check liquidity → Did price sweep a key low first?

If these align ✅ → Trade has a high chance of success.

## What Happens If You Trade Without Confirmations?

🔹 You get stopped out too often.

🔹 You overtrade because you don’t filter bad setups.

🔹 You lose confidence in your strategy.

🔹 Your account slowly loses money over time.

📌 Example: If price hits SMA 50, you buy immediately. But there’s no rejection candle, and RSI is dropping → Price keeps falling, you hit SL.

## How to Become a Profitable Trader Using Confirmations

1️⃣ Create a Simple Checklist (Before Entering Any Trade)

✅ Trend Check: Is the trend up or down? (SMA 50, 100 confirmation)

✅ Price Action Check: Is there a strong rejection or breakout?

✅ Indicator Confirmation: Is RSI supporting the trade?

✅ Liquidity Check: Has price grabbed stop losses first?

📌 Example: If at least 3/4 confirmations are present → Take the trade. If not → Skip and wait.

2️⃣ Be Patient – Trade Less, Win More

A great trader does not trade every pullback or crossover. You only trade when confirmations align.

3️⃣ Track Your Trades & Improve

Write down:

✔ Why you entered.

✔ What confirmations you used.

✔ Did it work? If not, why?

This helps you refine your method over time.

## Final Answer: Can You Be a Good Trader Without Confirmations?

🚫 No. You will struggle and lose money long-term.

✅ Yes, IF you learn to wait for clear, high-quality setups before entering.
