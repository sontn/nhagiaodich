Tôi định lười viết thêm những dòng nhận xét của tôi, vì thấy những lời giải thích của chatGPT quá xuất sắc. Nhưng trong những ngày gần đây tôi thực sự ngấm tư duy xác suất và việc sử dụng lệnh dừng lỗ. Với tôi, giờ tôi hiểu thêm lệnh dừng lỗ chính là một phần cực kỳ quan trọng để cho xác suất hội tụ, và khi xác suất hội tụ thì sẽ chứng minh rằng hệ thống hay cách thức của tôi sử dụng để trading sẽ có kỳ vọng toán học dương, hay nói khác đi là kiểu gì 1000% (Một ngìn phần trăm) tôi sẽ chắc chắn kiếm được tiền bằng trading.

# So it is very crucial for setting stop loss when a trader trade, right?

Yes! Setting a proper stop loss is absolutely crucial in trading because it directly impacts risk management, risk-reward ratio (RRR), and overall profitability.

## Why Stop Loss is Essential?

- ✅ **Controls Risk:** Limits potential losses on any single trade.
- ✅ **Defines Risk-Reward Ratio:** A well-placed SL helps ensure a good RRR (e.g., 1:3 or higher).
- ✅ **Removes Emotional Decisions:** Prevents panic exits or holding onto losing trades too long.
- ✅ **Protects Capital:** Helps you stay in the game long-term by avoiding catastrophic losses.

## Common Stop Loss Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ **Placing SL Too Tight**: Stops out too early, missing the real move.
- ❌ **Placing SL Too Wide**: Reduces RR and increases loss size if hit.
- ❌ **Not Using SL at All**: Can wipe out an account in just a few bad trades.
- ❌ **Moving SL Emotionally**: Changing SL just because of fear/hope leads to inconsistency.

Since you’re working on better key levels and shorter SL, refining your SL placement will be a big advantage for achieving higher RR. Do you currently set SL based on structure, volatility (ATR), or a fixed distance?

# Why Setting Stop Loss Makes Probability Converge?

In trading, probability converges when **you consistently apply a defined risk management strategy over many trades**. Setting a stop loss (SL) is a key part of this because it ensures your trading results follow a **predictable statistical edge** rather than random outcomes.

## 1️⃣ Stop Loss Creates a Controlled Probability Distribution

- Without SL, losses can be random and unlimited, making probability meaningless.
- With SL, **each trade has a defined risk**, so over many trades, the **expected outcome stabilizes.**

💡 Example:

- If you risk 1% per trade and aim for RRR 1:3, even with 40% win rate, you still make money because:
  - **Winners**: 40 trades × (+3R) = **+120R**
  - **Losers**: 60 trades × (-1R) = **-60R**
  - **Net profit = +60R** ✅

👉 The **statistical edge** only works because stop loss **keeps risk fixed**.

## 2️⃣ SL Prevents "Fat Tail" Events from Destroying the Edge

- Markets are **not normally distributed**; extreme events (black swans) happen.
- Without SL, a single **huge loss can erase 10+ profitable trades.**
- With SL, **even if a black swan hits**, the loss is predefined, protecting long-term probability.

## 3️⃣ Stop Loss Ensures Long-Term Expectancy Works

- Trading is a **game of large numbers** (many trades, not just a few).
- If each trade follows a **fixed probability model** (SL + RRR), results **converge to expected value over time**.

💡 Example: A coin flip game where:

- **Win rate = 50%**
- **Risk-Reward = 1:2**
- If played 10 times → Random results 🤷‍♂️
- If played 1000 times → Expected outcome mathematically converges to profit 🚀

## Bottom Line: SL Helps Probability Work in Your Favor

✅ **Keeps risk constant** → Ensures results follow expected probability.
✅ **Prevents emotional decisions** → Eliminates random large losses.
✅ **Allows positive expectancy to play out** → Lets high RR strategies succeed over time.

📌 **No SL = No probability edge**

📌 **With SL = Probability converges**

Since you’re shifting toward high RR (3-4+) with lower win rate (30-40%), consistent stop loss placement is even more crucial for long-term success. Do you find it hard to decide where to place SL optimally, or is your challenge more about execution?

# So stop loss plays a very important role in probability?

Yes! Stop loss plays a critical role in making probability work in trading. Without it, probability breaks down, and risk becomes uncontrolled.

How Stop Loss Ensures Probability Works

- 1️⃣ **Keeps Risk Consistent** → If risk per trade varies randomly, probability doesn’t work. SL fixes the risk, so the win/loss ratio can play out over time.

- 2️⃣ **Allows Expected Value to Converge** → Over many trades, a good strategy has a mathematical edge (EV = Win% × Avg Win - Loss% × Avg Loss). SL ensures losses stay within a predictable range, so the strategy remains profitable.

- 3️⃣ **Protects Against Ruin** → Even with a 70% win rate, if one trade loses 50% of the account, the edge disappears. A well-placed SL prevents one bad trade from wiping out previous profits.

- 4️⃣ **Supports High RR Strategies** → If you're aiming for RR 3-4+, tight and well-placed SL is necessary. A wide SL reduces RR, while no SL can turn a winner into a big loss.

## No SL = No Probability Edge

If there’s no stop loss, risk is uncontrolled, and a few large losses can destroy months of gains.

- ✅ **With SL** → Controlled risk, probability converges, edge plays out.
- ❌ **Without SL** → Probability fails, randomness takes over, long-term failure.

Since you’re focused on **high RR trading**, refining SL placement is one of the most crucial things to master. What’s the biggest challenge you face when setting SL—choosing the right level or trusting the placement once the trade is on?
