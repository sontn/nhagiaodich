## 1. Current Consolidation Zone

- The price is consolidating near the **major resistance level (~137.22)**, indicating hesitation from both buyers and sellers.

- This consolidation forms a **rectangle pattern**, a typical signal of indecision in the market.

- **Key levels to watch:**

  - Resistance at ~137.22.

  - Support around ~110-115 (lower bound of the consolidation range).

## 2. Historical Resistance at 137.22

- This level has been tested multiple times over the past years and continues to act as a psychological barrier.

- Previous attempts to break above this level (e.g., in 2021 and endly 2024) resulted in rejections and strong sell-offs.

- If the price successfully breaks above 137.22, the next likely target will be **~160-180**, followed by **~200+**.

## 3. Volume Analysis

- Volume Insight: The recent rally into the 137.22 resistance zone was accompanied by a rise in volume, signaling buyer interest.

- However, during the consolidation phase, volume has been tapering off, which is typical before a major breakout or breakdown.

- Watch for a **volume surge** as an early indicator of the next big move.

## 4. RSI (Relative Strength Index)

- The RSI is currently **in bullish territory (~62)** but has not yet entered the overbought zone.
- The RSI momentum suggests that buyers are still in control, though a slight cooling-off can be observed.
- A break above 137.22 could push RSI into overbought territory, confirming further upside momentum.

## 5. Potential Outcomes

### Bullish Scenario

**Breakout above 137.22:**

- This would indicate that buyers have regained control, confirming a continuation of the uptrend.
- Targets:
  - First target: ~160-180.
  - Second target: ~200-220.
- A surge in volume is critical to validate this breakout.

### Bearish Scenario

**Breakdown below the lower consolidation support (~110):**

- This would suggest sellers are dominating, and the price could retrace to ~80-100, which is a significant historical support zone.

- Volume on the breakdown will be an essential confirmation.

# Trading Plan

## For Bullish Bias:

- Wait for a clean break and close above 137.22 on the weekly chart, accompanied by high volume.
- Place stop-loss slightly below 137.22 to protect against a false breakout.

## For Bearish Bias:

- Wait for a break and close below 110, confirming a downside move.
- Stop-loss can be placed just above the lower consolidation box (~115).

## Neutral Stance:

- If the price remains in the current range, avoid trading to minimize exposure to sideways movement.
